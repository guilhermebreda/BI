# Operations Intelligence Analyst Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the **Operations Intelligence Analyst** technical challenge.

## Introduction

Hi, my name is **Guilherme Breda Rezende**, and this repository contains my solution for the **Operations Intelligence Analyst Challenge**.  

My approach combined **exploratory data analysis in Python** (to understand transaction patterns, KPIs, and anomalies) with an **interactive dashboard in Google Looker Studio** (to deliver clear, executive-friendly insights). I also proposed an **AI-powered assistant** to automate KPI tracking and anomaly detection, turning daily operations into actionable intelligence.  

This work reflects not only the technical execution of the challenge but also how I approach **data-driven problem solving, business storytelling, and automation opportunities**.

## 📊 Dataset
- [Operations_analyst_data.csv](Operations_analyst_data.csv) — transaction dataset provided for the challenge.

## 📓 Exploratory Analysis
- [exploratory_analysis.ipynb](exploratory_analysis.ipynb) — Jupyter Notebook with initial exploration, KPI calculations, and visualizations.

## 📈 Interactive Dashboard
Built in **Google Looker Studio**.  
[View the Dashboard here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/7324f2fd-ef5b-4bee-a209-89c83a980bcd)  

Includes KPIs, segment analysis, transactional behavior, anticipation methods, and AI bot proposal.
