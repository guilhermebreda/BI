# Operations Intelligence Analyst Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the **Operations Intelligence Analyst** technical challenge at CloudWalk.

## Introduction

Hi, my name is **Guilherme Breda Rezende**, and this repository contains my solution for the **Operations Intelligence Analyst Challenge at CloudWalk**.  

My approach combined **exploratory data analysis in Python** (to understand transaction patterns, KPIs, and anomalies) with an **interactive dashboard in Google Looker Studio** (to deliver clear, executive-friendly insights). I also proposed an **AI-powered assistant** to automate KPI tracking and anomaly detection, turning daily operations into actionable intelligence.  

This work reflects not only the technical execution of the challenge but also how I approach **data-driven problem solving, business storytelling, and automation opportunities**.

## 📊 Dataset
- `Operations_analyst_data.csv` — transaction dataset provided for the challenge.

## 📓 Exploratory Analysis
- `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with initial exploration, KPI calculations, and visualizations.

## 📈 Interactive Dashboard
- Built in **Google Looker Studio**.  
- [View the Dashboard here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/7324f2fd-ef5b-4bee-a209-89c83a980bcd)  
- Includes KPIs, segment analysis, transactional behavior, anticipation methods, and AI bot proposal.

## 🖼️ Screenshots

## 🤖 AI Assistant Proposal
- Concept for a CloudWalk AI bot to deliver daily KPI updates, anomaly alerts, and growth insights directly to Slack or email.
